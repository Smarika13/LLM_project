The mode of or dering queues and how long \\ncustomers should wait for a service or product has laid the base for determining the most optimal queuing \\nsolution that can give a tradeoff towards minimizing operation cost incurred while optimizing queues, and also \\nminimizing the time taken by customers waiting to be served. As the current economies gradually transition \\nfrom platform dependent to service oriented, it has become trivial to thoroughly grasp how to effectively \\nmanage waiting lines and in turn improve on the custome r satisfaction in an organization. This project has \\nexamined the shortfalls of traditional and current approached to queue management, studied the types and \\napplications of various queue management systems, and finally formulated a general approach and \\nmethodology to design and develop the virtual queue management system. \\nKeywords: virtual queue management, mobile queues, online tickets, virtual waiting lines\\n \\nINTRODUCTION \\nHaving to wait for services in waiting lines has become an anticipated part of modern life, people can be found \\nwaiting to be served at banks, retail stores, post offices and even waiting on hold on telephone calls to access \\nservice operators. Queueing and waiting in line causes inconvenience and frustration to those waiting to be \\nserved. The sheer length of the waiting line can be enough to discourage customers from pursuing valuable \\nservices, or even cause customers having important events to either miss or delay them. In today’s competitive \\nenvironment, businesses are occasioned by the n eed for improving customers satisfaction, normally actuated \\nby having better service operation capabilities to gain competitive edge in the marketplace [1]. Often, this \\nchange has led to increased importance and attention towards service operations managem ent. The need to \\nimprove customer interaction and service has given rise to CRM innovations that allow new systems to be \\ndeveloped for managing and analyzing customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle [2]. \\nThe virtual queue management system is one such system which allows queue management to be provided as \\na service to customers and eliminates traditional queue ordering rules that are currently designed and \\nimplemented in organizations.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2018-08-15T07:48:41+03:00', 'author': 'Muisyo', 'moddate': '2018-08-15T07:48:41+03:00', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/llm_workshop/Virtual-Queue-Management-System.pdf', 'total_pages': 29, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='International Journal of Social Sciences and Information Technology \\nISSN 2412-0294 \\nVol IV Issue VIII, August 2018    \\n© Ngugi, Mwai, Njomo                                                      9   \\nI. BACKGROUND \\nA waiting line occurs within a system involving customers arriving for a product or serving, queuing when the \\nservice is not immediate then leaving the queue once the customer has been served. The queuing theory lay \\nthe base for finding the most optimal solution to queue management. By defi nition, ‘a queue entails a line of \\npeople or Vehicles waiting in succession in turn to be attended to or to proceed [3]’. Sometimes, in places \\nhaving a lot of people queuing, there may be a system of numbered tickets and when someone arrives, they \\ntake a number and wait in line. A Queue management system is a software for queuing customers and gathering \\ntheir feedbacks, monitoring real -time information and speeding up of services.  Currently, queues are \\nimplemented in three ways: \\ni. Standard Linear Queues:  This form of queuing represents the normal or standard queue system \\nwhere each service desk or cashier has a separate line [3].  \\nii. Single Line Queues:  Also referred to as a Call Forward System, a single line groups customers and \\nthen feeds them to multiple cashiers or service areas. Often, Individual service stations are allocated to \\ndifferent service personnel part of one long counter or desk [3].  \\niii. Dispersed or “Digital” Queues: This type of queue management disperses waiting lines by offering a \\nticketing management system [3]. \\nThe order of service of queues specifies the order in which customers are chosen for service within a queue. \\nAmong the disciplines under this category are: \\ni. First Come, First Served (FCFS): this mode is commonly applied real-world situations, such as tellers \\nin a bank. \\nii. Last Come, First Served (LCFS): This mode acts a reverse order service given to customer against their \\narrival. \\niii. Priority Discipline (PD): Under this discipline, customers are classified into categories, then each \\ncategory is given different priorities. \\nTraditionally, queues are generally FCFS or LCFS and attempts to re -ordering a tradition queue by cutting \\nthrough lines creates social friction [4]. As a result, queues tend to have long waiting hours, not only due to \\ninadequate service propagation among staff but also due to missed or miscalled tickets that usually lead to \\nunnecessary wastage of time.  \\n \\nPROBLEM STATEMENT \\nHaving to physically queue in line or waiting for hour in waiting rooms and crowded lobbies has grown to be  \\na major community problem. It’s strange that with all the advancement in technology, this mode has not \\nchanged much over the last millennium. The model of waiting in lines is very inefficient, customers have to \\nbe in line in order to be served even if the  line may have more than a hundred customers ahead. Despite this \\nfact, service-based organizations that have the longest waiting time are making very little effort to improve on \\nit.

The system \\nallows customers to book services online or within the premise using an in-house device which communicates \\nto a web-based API handling booking requests and dispersing bookings to allocated services. Customers with \\nan android app can use Google maps API to get around locations and view places implementing the service \\nqueues. The application can then show profiles, and services offered with the option to get online tickets. Once \\nassigned a “digital token”, a customer is updated on the progress of the queue in real time. The mobile app \\ntracks the estimated time for waits and gives notifications on number of people also waiting for their turn. \\nTimely updates such as push notification on android or IOS and SMS using messaging gateways are sent to \\ncustomers communicating their time to access a service. This enables customers to wait for their turns in any \\nlocation of their choosing. \\nThe developed system also implements a web-based application that monitors and tracks customers in queues. \\nAgents manning the queues can call customers and provide specialized service. The system also captures key \\ndata based on the engagement and can be used in profiling customers and reaching out later based on the \\ncontact details given during registration. T he developed system enables service -based environment achieve \\ngreater efficiency in handling customer queues and offer innovative ways to interact with customers.

LITERATURE REVIEW \\nINTRODUCTION \\nThis literature review was undertaken primarily to underpin the implementation of Virtual queue management \\nsystems, how they are structured, designed and implemented in many different organizations. It provides the \\nsystematic background information, key features and implementation in the organizations across the country \\nand in other parts of the world. \\nTRADITIONAL SYSTEMS \\nTraditional queuing solutions involve linear queues where customers wait in line physically. Not only is it the \\noldest form of queui ng, but also the most common way for managing queues and waiting. There are several \\nvariations of Linear queues: \\nSingle Queue Single Service Point (SQSSP) \\nThis variation offers a First in First out model, customers are served in the order in which they arrive. Typically, \\nthe SQSSO is found in service centers having few customers such as fast food restaurants and coffee shops.  \\nMultiple Queue Multiple Service Points (MQMSP) \\nThis variation segments customers based on their service needs such that those requiring longer service times \\nare separated from those with smaller requirements. \\nSingle Queue Multiple Service Points (SQMSP) \\nServices are distributed in a logical manner and gives priority to customers to entered the queue first. Slow \\ncustomers may affect the overall delivery but every customer will be directed to the available counter. \\nCURRENT SYSTEMS \\nWAVETEC: VIRTUAL QUEUE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \\nThe queue management system provided by wavetec offers standard and customizable features for queue \\nmanagement. These features are geared towards solving queuing problems faced by organizations by offering \\ndiverse queuing solutions. Businesses have options for basic, enterprise or mobile queuing system with each \\nable to manage and disperse crowds effectively. Customers are able to seamlessly journey through the system \\nthrough their virtual and linear queuing systems and also access an appointment booking option. Wavetec also \\ncomes with premium services which integrate enterprises that offer sophisticated or multi branch and  multi \\nregion services with their distributed queuing solutions. Customers interact with the systems via inhouse \\nchannels such as self-service desks, websites or a mobile app and receive a ticket. \\n Key Features \\ni. Accurate prediction of waiting times from TV monitors and notifications. \\nii. Business are able to customize the queue solutions to meet their needs. \\niii. Wavetec systems can easily integrate with other preexisting platforms. \\niv. Customers are engaged with digital signage whilst they wait in line.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2018-08-15T07:48:41+03:00', 'author': 'Muisyo', 'moddate': '2018-08-15T07:48:41+03:00', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/llm_workshop/Virtual-Queue-Management-System.pdf', 'total_pages': 29, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='International Journal of Social Sciences and Information Technology \\nISSN 2412-0294 \\nVol IV Issue VIII, August 2018    \\n© Ngugi, Mwai, Njomo                                                      13   \\nCASE STUDY \\nHuduma Kenya: This is a one stop shop initiative by the Kenyan government aimed at transforming the \\ndelivery mechanism of public service. Following an understanding of customer footfalls and retail services \\noffered at Huduma centers, Wavetec was able to insta ll complete queue management system comprising of \\ndual printer touch screen device, customer dispatching and calling and display system. The system is built to \\ncustomize the specialized workflows prevalent at Huduma Centers. As traffic in these Huduma cent ers \\nincreased with over 20 public services, more counters were needed to cater for the high influx using a \\nsystematic and automated queueing system. \\nBanks in Kenya: There had been an increase in the number of customers in banks at their various branches. \\nThis brought about problems of dissatisfied customers who complained of inefficient services. KCB (Kenya \\nCommercial Bank), one of the leading banks in Kenya, unveiled the first queuing solution and distributed it to \\ntheir service centers in an attempt to disperse long queues.  \\n \\nQLESS:  MOBILE QUEUE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \\nQLess a company that offers software as a service (SAAS) provides a queue management system that helps \\neliminate waiting lines. The system is developed to enable customers wait in a virtual line instead of a physical \\none. Once a customer joins one virtual line, the customer receives an SMS text, notification, audio -visual or \\nvoice call to keep them notified as they proceed to the service area. \\nQLess allow manages to allocate users to a virtual line in the following ways; A touchscreen device or website \\ncan be located in the physical location of the key and customers are able to join the queue from this device; \\nUsing a mobile app provided by QLess, users can get virtual token; sending SMS text or re ceiving a call \\nthrough an automated voice call. Business using QLess obtain reports and statistics on their busiest hours, \\ncustomers cancelling or returning. \\nKey Features   \\ni. QLess offers virtual queues accessed via websites, a mobile app or onsite kiosk. \\nii. Appointment booking enabling easy walk in if scheduled and reducing long gaps especially on busy \\ndays. \\niii. Timely updates enabling interactive communication. This is through SMS text and app notifications to \\nalert customers on the status of the queue CASE STUDY \\n \\nCASE STUDY \\nMedical professional at a Nevada-based (USA) Renown Medical Group needed to improve their patient service \\nflow. After several queuing options, they finally settled on QLess. This helped patients skip waiting rooms by \\nbooking queues online and j oin virtual lines either from home or work enabling them arrive just in time for \\ntheir appointment. The integration was very effective such that customers would be alerted 15 minutes in \\nadvance of appointment either by text or notification and also dispers e all bottlenecks in service areas. Staff \\ncould then monitor and manage real time data provided by the system, and also obtain information on delays \\nto better control expectations and minimize frustrations.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2018-08-15T07:48:41+03:00', 'author': 'Muisyo', 'moddate': '2018-08-15T07:48:41+03:00', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/llm_workshop/Virtual-Queue-Management-System.pdf', 'total_pages': 29, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='International Journal of Social Sciences and Information Technology \\nISSN 2412-0294 \\nVol IV Issue VIII, August 2018    \\n© Ngugi, Mwai, Njomo                                                      14   \\nQ-SYS: QUEUE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \\nQ-SYS is part of the RIANA Group of companies, which is a leading business solutions provider in Kenya. Q-\\nSYS has been identified as one of the strongest brands in the region by London based The Centre for Brand \\nAnalysis and has achieved the status of Super brand East Afri ca. Q-SYS allows businesses to track, monitor, \\nregulate and control visitor movements within business facilities.  Q - SYS is currently implemented in service \\ncenters in banks, hospitals, embassies, government offices, ticket counters, or any place where c lients queue \\nup to access specialized services. \\nKey Features \\nQ-SYS offers management of customer wait times, manages front desk, and reporting, digital signage and real \\ntime monitoring. With the tools provided, business can obtain real-time access to performance metrics such as \\ncustomer in flow, customer wait time, average service time, employee efficiency and customer feedback. \\nCASE STUDY \\nQ-Sys has been able to offer industry solutions for the healthcare, retail and finance sectors along with reliable \\nfollow-up tools. KCB (Kenya Commercial Bank), equity Bank, Alpha Commercial Bank, National Bank of \\nRwanda (BNR) and several other firms are some of the clients currently implementing service queues provided \\nby Q-SYS. \\n \\nSKIPLINO: MOBILE QUEUE MANAGEMENT APPLICATION \\nSkiplino is a multilingual system for queue management allowing customers to be managed efficiently and \\nwith easy. This is made possible by offering an integrated cloud based queueing solution that monitors data \\nrelating to queue in real time and obtain customer feedback. \\n Key Features \\ni. Tracks how long customers have been waiting in line and provide instant feedback. This helps avoid \\npreventable customer complaints that can damage the company reputation. \\nii. Branch management monitoring regardless of geographical distance from headquarters. \\niii. Fast and easy response time to demands from visitors and customers. \\nLACUNAS \\nUneven Queue Distribution  \\nCustomers can be discouraged to wait in line when on premise, they find a single long queue. This situation \\nmay be caus ed by lack of planning on lines and queue distribution. This problem can easily be solved by \\nincorporating such a system that can reliably predict queueing patterns and evenly distribute customers to \\nqueues. \\n Service Based Queue Delivery  \\nThe current indus try is a service dominating one. Despite this, most queue implementation are still offered \\ninhouse. This entails that huge investments in infrastructure and logistics must be planned beforehand to \\nimplement a queueing system.

SYSTEM METHODOLOGY \\nINTRODUCTION \\nSystem Methodology involves dividing software development work distinct stages and coming up with tasks \\nor activities aimed at achieving better planning and ti me management. It is considered a trivial part of the \\nsystems development life cycle. \\nTHE WATERFALL MODEL \\nThe Waterfall approach is one of the most popular model in Software engineering, it was in fact the very first \\nSDLC model to be used. The approach tak en was to treat the whole process of modelling software in a \\nsequential order, the outcome or output of the previous step would serve as the input for the next step. This \\nwould enable software developers to separate these steps into distinct stages, with each phase having different \\nrequirements and activities.  The illustration bellows shows a representation of the stages found in the Waterfall \\nModel. \\n \\nFigure 1 System methodology'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2018-08-15T07:48:41+03:00', 'author': 'Muisyo', 'moddate': '2018-08-15T07:48:41+03:00', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/llm_workshop/Virtual-Queue-Management-System.pdf', 'total_pages': 29, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content='International Journal of Social Sciences and Information Technology \\nISSN 2412-0294 \\nVol IV Issue VIII, August 2018    \\n© Ngugi, Mwai, Njomo                                                      16   \\nThe sequential phases in Waterfall model are:  \\ni. Requirement Gathering and analysis:  This phase involved performing a feasibility study and \\nascertaining all possible requirement of the system.  \\nii. System Design: This phase involves getting specifications, functional and non-functional requirements \\nof both softwa re and hardware required to develop the system. This step also involved defining the \\nsystem architecture. \\niii. Implementation: With outcome from system design of the developed system prototype, the system \\nwas developed in small programs called units, which were pushed to the next stage to be tested. \\niv. Integration and Testing:  All the units developed in the implementation were integrated into the \\nsystem, isolated and fully tested. Once verified to be working, the entire system was tested to detect \\nany undetected failures or faults. \\nv. Deployment of system: Once testing was done, the developed system was deployed and tested with \\nlive customer data. \\nvi. Maintenance. Maintenance of the developed system was to be done in continuum to ascertain that all \\nfunctional and nonfunctional requirements were reached and any changes to the software and hardware \\nwould not affect the customer environment.  \\n \\nJUSTIFICATIONS \\nWaterfall model is preferable as it has provision for changes and the changes can be implemented in the \\nmaintenance phase. This is because the waterfall model is simple and easy to understand and use for the \\ndeveloper and the other users. This model also allows for early design changes and places emphasis on \\nrequirement and design before writing any single line of code which ensures minimal time wastage and effort \\nin design changes. \\n \\nIV.

SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING \\nINTRODUCTION  \\nSystem testing involves checking each of the system modules to make sure that they are functioning properly. \\nSystem implementation is done after successful system testing to incorporate the new system into an \\norganization using any of the various changeover methods. \\nDATABASE TESTING  \\nThe database systems used in this project are MySQL by Oracle Technologies and firebase, a Realtime NoSQL \\ndatabase by Google. Database testing was done after system development to check whether the database was \\nable to store the desired data as well as testing its integration with other components of the system. The \\ndeveloper used various categories of data to test the integrity of the database. First normal range data was used \\nand the results were valid after processing. Extreme data was used to test whether the system could \\naccommodate the extreme ranges . Further, exceptional data was used to test how the system would respond \\nwhen subjected to invalid data. \\nConsider the following test data performed on the Users table. The two fields under test are Email and \\npassword. \\nFIELD NAME DATA TYPE TEST DATA RESPONSE COMMENT \\nEmail varchar admin@admin.com Accepted Valid \\nEmail varchar Admin.com Rejected Invalid \\nEmail Varchar admin@admin.com \\n(email already \\nexists) \\nRejected Valid \\nPassword Varchar Password01 Accepted Valid \\nPassword Varchar #pAssword \\n(Confirmation \\nError) \\nRejected Invalid \\nTable 1 Database testing \\nUNIT TESTING  \\nUnit involves testing software with a small piece of source code [5]. VQMS is built on top of the Laravel php \\nframework, thus has access to a custom TDD library. When performing tests, some assertions would be made, \\nand the testing function would then assert if true or false.  \\nSource code for unit testing were created by the developer as a part of software development. The following \\nunit tests were performed to ascertain functionality. \\n \\nTEST \\nCASES \\n(TC#) \\nTEST NAME TEST \\nDESCRIPTION \\nSOFTWARE TEST \\nENVIRONMENT \\nTC1 Navigation \\nTests \\nThis test verifies if the \\nuser is able to navigate \\nthe site and access all \\nVQMS  Windows Home \\nEdition, 500GB HDD, \\n6GB RAM, Apache'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2018-08-15T07:48:41+03:00', 'author': 'Muisyo', 'moddate': '2018-08-15T07:48:41+03:00', 'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/llm_workshop/Virtual-Queue-Management-System.pdf', 'total_pages': 29, 'page': 24, 'page_label': '25'}, page_content='International Journal of Social Sciences and Information Technology \\nISSN 2412-0294 \\nVol IV Issue VIII, August 2018    \\n© Ngugi, Mwai, Njomo                                                      32   \\nURLs.

The \\nsystem brings about quick and e asy management of queues with very little cost and can be successfully \\nimplemented in medium crowd environment and thus help in the elimination of physical lines and waiting time \\nall over the country in service-based institutions and organizations. \\nVI. PROJECT SUCCESS \\nA novel intelligent system for quick and effective management of queues using virtual tickets has been \\ndeveloped. The system allows customers to access virtual tokens online or via kiosks at service centers. They \\nare then notified via SMS or notifications when it is their turn. All this is done in a centralized system that \\nhandles requests and dispatches responses to various distributed entities. The system lay s out the base \\nfoundations for the existing ticket management systems, aiming that one day, after its continuous improvement, \\nit becomes a full ﬂedged product, battle tested, and ready to be deployed in schools or institutions looking for \\na better management of their services.  \\nVII. FUTURE WORKS \\nIn future, it would be interesting to implement the system with additional features that would make it work \\nmore efficiently. The following are some of the noted improvements that can be made on the system in future.  \\ni. Integrate the system with physical hardware and token management Systems. \\nii. Back-ofﬁce usability testing. \\niii. Possible inclusion of Web Sockets. \\niv. Extend next-ticket metadata (based on acquired data, for data mining and trends matching). \\nv. Test in a production or simulated production environment. \\nvi. Deploy to production. \\nREFERENCES \\n[1] Kostecki M., “Waiting Lines as a Marketing Issue”, European Management Journal, Vol. 14,  \\nNo.3, pp. 295-303, 1996 \\n[2] \"The importance of management information systems | Library Review | Vol 46, No \\n5\", Emeraldinsight.com, 2017.

Queueing and waiting in line causes inconvenience and frustration to those waiting to be \\nserved. The sheer length of the waiting line can be enough to discourage customers from pursuing valuable \\nservices, or even cause customers having important events to either miss or delay them.

BACKGROUND \\nA waiting line occurs within a system involving customers arriving for a product or serving, queuing when the \\nservice is not immediate then leaving the queue once the customer has been served. The queuing theory lay \\nthe base for finding the most optimal solution to queue management. By defi nition, ‘a queue entails a line of \\npeople or Vehicles waiting in succession in turn to be attended to or to proceed [3]’. Sometimes, in places \\nhaving a lot of people queuing, there may be a system of numbered tickets and when someone arrives, they \\ntake a number and wait in line. A Queue management system is a software for queuing customers and gathering \\ntheir feedbacks, monitoring real -time information and speeding up of services.

Currently, queues are \\nimplemented in three ways: \\ni. Standard Linear Queues:  This form of queuing represents the normal or standard queue system \\nwhere each service desk or cashier has a separate line [3].  \\nii. Single Line Queues:  Also referred to as a Call Forward System, a single line groups customers and \\nthen feeds them to multiple cashiers or service areas. Often, Individual service stations are allocated to \\ndifferent service personnel part of one long counter or desk [3].  \\niii. Dispersed or “Digital” Queues: This type of queue management disperses waiting lines by offering a \\nticketing management system [3]. \\nThe order of service of queues specifies the order in which customers are chosen for service within a queue. \\nAmong the disciplines under this category are: \\ni.
